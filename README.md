S&P 500 Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the price of the S&P 500 stock market index using machine learning techniques in Python. By leveraging historical data, we build and refine predictive models to enhance forecasting accuracy.

Key steps include:
	•	Retrieving historical stock data using yfinance.
	•	Processing and analyzing data with pandas.
	•	Developing an initial machine learning model using scikit-learn.
	•	Implementing a backtesting engine for more accurate performance evaluation.
	•	Optimizing the model to improve prediction accuracy.

The project provides insights into stock market trends and explores effective strategies for time series forecasting.
